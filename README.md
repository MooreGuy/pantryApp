pantryApp
=========

Want to keep track of your noms? Who wouldn't? 

CloudPantry is a short but sweet application that will store all of
the food your mom buys on the cloud. Later, you can send your mom
shoppng lists from the comfort of your own basement. Never worry
about having to yell at those silly parents for HotPockets again!

Pantry App uses a global foods database which you can access
the foods that were created by every single CloudPantry user!
WOW! Much feature. So not bug.

The next step is to making your individual pantry, and giving it a
unique name! Basement will work for most of you. 

After that you can begin to add your foods to your pantry! 
Enjoy!
